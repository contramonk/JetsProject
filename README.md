###How to Run
####This program runs from the file JetsTest.java in the terminal.
###Synopsis
####This is our week two project at skill distillery. This version is a fully
####functional working program, though work needs to be done with user input errors.

####This program begins with five jets. The user can add a jet to the fleet, or
####add a pilot to a jet. They can also list the jets with some sorting options.

####also i wanted the lists to look more like a spreadsheet, but had trouble
####getting the formatting to stick when different sized elements are entered.
